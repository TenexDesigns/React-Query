Paginated Queries in React Query allow you to efficiently fetch and display large datasets in a paginated manner, dividing the data into smaller, more manageable pages. This is particularly useful for scenarios where rendering a large amount of data at once can negatively impact performance and user experience.

What it is

Paginated Queries utilize React Query's data fetching and caching mechanisms to retrieve data in incremental chunks, enabling users to navigate through the paginated data without causing performance issues. It involves making multiple API requests, each fetching a specific page of data, and then combining the retrieved data to display the current page.

How to Implement It

Implementing Paginated Queries with React Query involves several steps:

Define the Pagination State: Maintain a state variable to track the current page number.

Fetch Paginated Data: Use the useQuery hook to fetch paginated data, specifying the current page number in the query key.

Handle Pagination Changes: Update the current page number based on user interactions, such as clicking pagination buttons.

Render Paginated Data: Conditionally render the fetched data based on the current page number.

Provide Pagination Controls: Display pagination controls, such as buttons or links, to allow users to navigate between pages.

Code Samples

Here's an example of implementing Paginated Queries with React Query:

JavaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const pageSize = 10;

const PaginatedPosts = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);

  const fetchPosts = async (pageNumber) => {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_page=${pageNumber}&_limit=${pageSize}`);
    return response.data;
  };

  const { isLoading, data, error } = useQuery('posts', fetchPosts);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>An error occurred: {error}</div>;
  }

  const handlePageChange = (pageNumber) => {
    setCurrentPage(pageNumber);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {data.map((post) => (
          <div key={post.id}>
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>{post.body}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>

        
<button
 
onClick={() => handlePageChange(currentPage - 1)} disabled={currentPage === 1}>Previous</button>

        
<button
 
onClick={() => handlePageChange(currentPage + 1)}>Next</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default PaginatedPosts;

In this example, the useQuery hook is used to fetch a specific page of posts based on the current page number, which is stored in the currentPage state. The handlePageChange function updates the currentPage state, triggering a re-fetch of the query with the updated page number. The pagination controls allow users to navigate between pages, and the rendered data is filtered to display only the posts from the current page.

Benefits of Paginated Queries

Performance Optimization: Paginated Queries prevent the rendering of large datasets at once, improving performance and reducing UI responsiveness issues.

Memory Management: By dividing data into smaller chunks, React Query can effectively manage memory usage and prevent memory leaks.

User Experience Enhancement: Paginated Queries provide a smoother and more manageable user experience for navigating through large amounts of data.

Conclusion

Paginated Queries are an essential tool for handling large datasets in React applications. They ensure efficient data fetching, optimal performance, and an enhanced user experience. React Query provides a powerful framework for implementing paginated queries, enabling developers to manage the complexities of data retrieval and rendering in a structured and efficient manner.
