Refetch Defaults in React Query are a set of options that control how and when React Query refetches data from the server. They provide a convenient way to customize the refetch behavior for your application's needs.

**refetchOnMount:**

This option instructs React Query to refetch data whenever the component that depends on the query mounts. It ensures that the component always starts with the latest data, regardless of when it was last fetched.

**refetchOnWindowFocus:**

This option enables React Query to refetch data when the window regains focus. It's useful for refreshing data when the user returns to the application after a period of inactivity.

**Other Refetch Defaults:**

React Query offers additional refetch options, including:

- `refetchInterval`: Automatically refetches data at a specified interval.

- `refetchOnReconnect`: Refetches data when the network connection is restored.

- `refetchOnMountOrReconnect`: Refetches data on mount or when the network reconnects.

**How to Use Refetch Defaults:**

You can apply refetch defaults to individual queries using the `useQuery` hook's options object. For example, to set `refetchOnMount` for a query:

```javascript
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('myQuery', fetchMyData, {
  refetchOnMount: true,
});
```

**Where to Use Refetch Defaults:**

Refetch defaults are particularly useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that users are always seeing the most up-to-date information. For instance, you might use `refetchOnMount` for a query that displays real-time data or `refetchOnWindowFocus` for a query that shows user-specific information.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Excessive refetching can degrade performance, so use refetch defaults judiciously.

- Consider using `staleTime` in conjunction with refetch defaults to balance freshness with performance.

- Implement conditional rendering techniques to handle loading states during background refetches.

By effectively utilizing refetch defaults, you can optimize your React application's data fetching behavior to deliver a seamless and up-to-date user experience.
