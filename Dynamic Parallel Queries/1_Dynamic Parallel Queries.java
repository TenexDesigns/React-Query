In React Query, Dynamic Parallel Queries refer to the scenario where the number of queries you need to execute can change from render to render. In such cases, you cannot use manual querying as it would violate the rules of hooks. Instead, you can use the `useQueries` hook provided by React Query, which allows you to dynamically execute as many queries in parallel as you need.

Here's an example of how you might use dynamic parallel queries with React Query:

```jsx
import { useQueries } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchUser = async (userId) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`);
  return response.data;
};

export default function useUserData(userIds) {
  return useQueries(
    userIds.map((id) => {
      return {
        queryKey: ['user', id],
        queryFn: () => fetchUser(id),
      };
    })
  );
}
```

In this example, we define a `fetchUser` function that fetches a user by ID. We then define a `useUserData` custom hook that uses the `useQueries` hook to fetch data for multiple users based on an array of user IDs. The `useQueries` hook returns an array of results, where each result corresponds to one of the user IDs.

Here's how you can use the `useUserData` hook in a component:

```jsx
import useUserData from './useUserData';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const userIds = [1, 2, 3];
  const userQueries = useUserData(userIds);

  return (
    <div>
      {userQueries.map((userQuery, index) => {
        if (userQuery.isLoading) return 'Loading...';
        if (userQuery.error) return `An error occurred: ${userQuery.error.message}`;

        return (
          <div key={userIds[index]}>
            {userQuery.data.name}
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this component, we use the `useUserData` hook to fetch data for multiple users. We then map over the `userQueries` array to render the data for each user. Note that each element in the `userQueries` array is an object with properties like `isLoading`, `error`, and `data` that you can use to handle the different states of the data fetching process [Source 1](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/guides/parallel-queries), [Source 2](https://medium.com/@bobjunior542/how-to-run-parallel-queries-in-react-query-5-for-better-performance-with-usequeries-73abbb593bcc).

Dynamic parallel queries in React Query involve initiating multiple queries based on dynamic data, such as an array of IDs, where each query fetches data for a specific ID. This is a common scenario when you have a list of items, and you want to fetch detailed information for each item in parallel.

Here's an example of how to implement dynamic parallel queries in React Query:

### Dynamic Parallel Queries Example:

Let's say you have a list of superhero IDs, and you want to fetch detailed information for each superhero in parallel.

```jsx
// SuperHeroList.js

import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchSuperHero = async (id) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/superheroes/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};

const SuperHeroList = ({ superheroIds }) => {
  // Initiate parallel queries for each superhero ID
  const queries = superheroIds.map((id) => {
    return useQuery(['superhero', id], () => fetchSuperHero(id));
  });

  // Wait for all queries to be ready
  const areQueriesLoading = queries.some((query) => query.isLoading);

  if (areQueriesLoading) {
    return <h2>Loading...</h2>;
  }

  // Access the data from each query
  const superHeroes = queries.map((query) => query.data);

  return (
    <div>
      {superHeroes.map((hero) => (
        <div key={hero.id}>
          <h2>{hero.name}</h2>
          <p>{hero.description}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SuperHeroList;
```

In this example:

- The `fetchSuperHero` function fetches superhero data based on a given ID.
- We map through the `superheroIds` array and use the `useQuery` hook for each ID to initiate parallel queries.
- We check if any of the queries are still loading (`areQueriesLoading`) to display a loading message.
- Finally, we access the data from each query to render superhero details.

### Where to Use Dynamic Parallel Queries:

1. **Lists with Detailed Information:**
   - Use dynamic parallel queries when you have a list of items, and you need to fetch detailed information for each item.

2. **Multiple Independent Data Fetching:**
   - When each item's data is independent and can be fetched concurrently.

3. **Optimizing Loading Time:**
   - Fetching data in parallel helps optimize the loading time of your components.

### Note:

- **Query Keys:** The query keys for each dynamic query should be unique. In this example, we use `['superhero', id]` as the query key to ensure uniqueness.

- **Optimistic Rendering:** React Query automatically handles the optimization of parallel queries, ensuring that the UI updates optimistically as each query completes.

- **Dependencies:** Ensure that your dependencies are correctly managed. If there are dependencies between queries, consider using the `enabled` option to control when queries are executed.

Dynamic parallel queries in React Query offer a flexible and efficient way to handle scenarios where you need to fetch data for multiple items concurrently.
