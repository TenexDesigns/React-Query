In React Query, you can use the `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onSettled` callbacks to handle side effects based on the state of a query.They pass the data OnSuccess and the Erro onErro, which you can access using the argument 
  These callbacks provide you with the ability to execute code when certain conditions are met during the lifecycle of a query.

Here's a brief explanation of each callback and how you might use them for side effects:

### 1. `onSuccess`:

- **What is `onSuccess`?**
  - `onSuccess` is a callback that gets executed when the query successfully fetches data.

- **How to Use `onSuccess`:**
  - You can define `onSuccess` in the configuration object passed to `useQuery` to handle side effects when the data is successfully fetched.

    ```jsx
    const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
      'myQueryKey',
      fetchDataFunction,
      {
        onSuccess: (fetchedData) => {
          // Execute side effects based on successful data fetch
          console.log('Data fetched successfully:', fetchedData);
        },
      }
    );
    ```

### 2. `onError`:

- **What is `onError`?**
  - `onError` is a callback that gets executed when an error occurs during the query.

- **How to Use `onError`:**
  - You can define `onError` in the configuration object passed to `useQuery` to handle side effects when an error occurs.

    ```jsx
    const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
      'myQueryKey',
      fetchDataFunction,
      {
        onError: (error) => {
          // Execute side effects based on query error
          console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        },
      }
    );
    ```

### 3. `onSettled`:

- **What is `onSettled`?**
  - `onSettled` is a callback that gets executed when the query is either successfully resolved or encounters an error (settled state).

- **How to Use `onSettled`:**
  - You can define `onSettled` in the configuration object passed to `useQuery` to handle side effects regardless of whether the query was successful or encountered an error.

    ```jsx
    const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
      'myQueryKey',
      fetchDataFunction,
      {
        onSettled: (data, error) => {
          // Execute side effects based on settled state
          if (error) {
            console.error('Query settled with an error:', error);
          } else {
            console.log('Query settled successfully:', data);
          }
        },
      }
    );
    ```

### Example Use Cases for Side Effects:

1. **Showing a Notification:**
   - Use `onSuccess` to show a success notification and `onError` to show an error notification.

2. **Logging:**
   - Log successful or error states using any logging library.

3. **Redirecting:**
   - Redirect the user to a different page on successful data fetch or handle redirection on error.

4. **Loading Spinners:**
   - Toggle loading spinners or loading indicators based on the `isLoading` state.

5. **Updating UI State:**
   - Update local state in your component based on the data or error received.

Here's an example that combines these callbacks:

```jsx
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
  'myQueryKey',
  fetchDataFunction,
  {
    onSuccess: (fetchedData) => {
      console.log('Data fetched successfully:', fetchedData);
      // Update local state, show success notification, etc.
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      // Update local state, show error notification, etc.
    },
    onSettled: (data, error) => {
      // Common cleanup or additional actions after the query settles
    },
  }
);
```

These callbacks provide you with flexibility to handle a wide range of side effects based on the outcome of the query. Adjust the side effects based on your specific use case and requirements.
