In React Query, parallel queries refer to the ability to execute multiple queries simultaneously rather than sequentially. This is useful when your component needs to fetch data from multiple endpoints independently, and you want to optimize the loading time by fetching them concurrently.

Here's an example of how to use parallel queries in React Query with code samples:

### Parallel Queries Example:

Assuming you have a component that needs to fetch data from two different endpoints, you can use the `useQuery` hook for each query and execute them in parallel.

```jsx
// ExampleComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchData1 = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data1');
  return response.data;
};

const fetchData2 = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data2');
  return response.data;
};

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  // Use useQuery for the first query
  const { data: data1, isLoading: isLoading1, error: error1 } = useQuery('queryKey1', fetchData1);

  // Use useQuery for the second query
  const { data: data2, isLoading: isLoading2, error: error2 } = useQuery('queryKey2', fetchData2);

  if (isLoading1 || isLoading2) {
    return <h2>Loading...</h2>;
  }

  if (error1 || error2) {
    return <h2>An error occurred: {error1 || error2}</h2>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Data from Endpoint 1:</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data1, null, 2)}</pre>

      <h2>Data from Endpoint 2:</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data2, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example:

- `fetchData1` and `fetchData2` are functions that fetch data from different endpoints.
- Two separate `useQuery` hooks are used to initiate parallel queries.
- The component renders loading messages while the data is being fetched, and it displays the data once both queries are successful.

### When to Use Parallel Queries:

1. **Independent Data Fetching:**
   - Use parallel queries when the data fetching from different endpoints is independent of each other, and they can be fetched concurrently.

2. **Optimizing Loading Time:**
   - Fetching data in parallel can optimize the loading time of your components, especially when there's no dependency between the data.

3. **Multiple API Endpoints:**
   - When your component needs to display information from multiple API endpoints, fetching the data concurrently helps improve performance.

### Important Note:

Make sure that parallel queries are appropriate for your use case. If the data from one query depends on the result of another query, consider using the `useQuery` option `enabled` or `staleTime` to control the timing of query execution.

```jsx
const { data: data1, isLoading: isLoading1, error: error1 } = useQuery('queryKey1', fetchData1, {
  enabled: someCondition, // Control when the query should be executed
});
```

By using `enabled` or `staleTime`, you can manage the timing of your queries to avoid unnecessary requests or ensure that certain queries are executed first.

  import { useQuery } from 'react-query'
import axios from 'axios'

const fetchSuperHeroes = () => {
  return axios.get('http://localhost:4000/superheroes')
}

const fetchFriends = () => {
  return axios.get('http://localhost:4000/friends')
}

export const ParallelQueriesPage = () => {
  const { data: superHeroes } = useQuery('super-heroes', fetchSuperHeroes)
  const { data: friends } = useQuery('friends', fetchFriends)
  console.log(superHeroes, friends)
  return <div>Parallel Queries</div>
}
