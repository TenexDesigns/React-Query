Sure, here's a breakdown of the provided code and how to use custom hooks to fetch data for reusability in React Query and React:

**Custom Hook for Fetching Data:**

The `usePostData` hook encapsulates the logic for fetching data from the specified URL and provides a reusable interface for components to access the fetched data. It utilizes React Query to manage data fetching and caching, ensuring efficient data retrieval and handling.

```javascript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return response.data;
};

export default function usePostData(onSuccess, onError) {
  return useQuery('posts', fetchData, {
    onSuccess: onSuccess,
    onError: onError,
    select: (data) => {
      const names = data.map((post) => post.id);
      return names;
    },
  });
}
```

**Consuming the Custom Hook:**

The `usePostData` hook is consumed in a React component, such as `MyComponent`, to access the fetched data and handle loading and error states. It provides callbacks for `onSuccess` and `onError` to perform side effects after successful data retrieval or encountering errors.

```javascript
import usePostData from './usePostData';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const onSuccess = (data) => {
    console.log('Perform side Effect after fetching data', data);
  };
  const onError = (error) => {
    console.log('Perform side effect after encountering error', error);
  };

  const { isLoading, error, data } = usePostData(onSuccess, onError);

  if (isLoading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `An error occurred: ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Data</div>

      {data &&
        data.map((name) => <div key={name}>{name}</div>)}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Benefits of Custom Hooks:**

Using custom hooks offers several advantages:

1. **Reusability:** Custom hooks encapsulate repetitive logic and can be reused across multiple components, promoting code organization and reducing duplication.

2. **Abstraction:** They hide the underlying implementation details, allowing components to focus on consuming data and rendering UI without worrying about the intricacies of data fetching.

3. **Maintainability:** Custom hooks make the code more maintainable by centralizing data fetching logic and separating it from component-specific rendering concerns.

4. **Testability:** Custom hooks can be tested independently, ensuring the data fetching and handling logic is reliable and error-free.

5. **Encapsulation:** They promote encapsulation by keeping data fetching logic within its own module, reducing clutter in components and improving code readability.

In summary, custom hooks are a valuable tool for managing data fetching and enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and testability in React applications. They provide a clean separation of concerns and allow components to focus on their primary purpose of rendering UI while delegating data retrieval and handling to dedicated hooks.
