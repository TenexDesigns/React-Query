Creating a custom hook for data fetching in React is a good practice to encapsulate the logic and make it reusable across components. In your example, you've created a custom hook called `usePostData`. Let me explain the code and provide some insights:

### Custom Hook (`usePostData.js`):

```jsx
// usePostData.js
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return response.data;
};

const usePostData = (onSuccess, onError) => {
  return useQuery('posts', fetchData, {
    onSuccess: onSuccess,
    onError: onError,
    select: (data) => {
      const names = data.map((post) => post.id);
      return names;
    },
  });
};

export default usePostData;
```

In this custom hook:

- `fetchData` is an asynchronous function that performs the data fetching using Axios.
- `usePostData` is the custom hook that uses `useQuery` from React Query. It takes `onSuccess` and `onError` callback functions as parameters, allowing you to perform side effects when data is successfully fetched or when an error occurs.
- The `select` option is used to transform the data before it is returned. In this case, it maps over the data and extracts the `id` from each post.

### Component (`MyComponent.js`):

```jsx
// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import usePostData from './usePostData';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const onSuccess = (data) => {
    console.log('Perform side effect after fetching data', data);
  };

  const onError = (error) => {
    console.log('Perform side effect after encountering error', error);
  };

  const { isLoading, error, data } = usePostData(onSuccess, onError);

  if (isLoading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `An error occurred: ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Data</div>
      {data &&
        data.map((name) => {
          return <div key={name}>{name}</div>;
        })}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In your component:

- `usePostData` is imported and used. It handles the data fetching logic.
- `onSuccess` and `onError` functions can be passed to handle side effects after successful data fetching or when an error occurs.
- Loading and error states are handled as usual.

### Why Use Custom Hooks for Data Fetching?

1. **Reusability:** You can reuse the data fetching logic across different components without duplicating code.

2. **Abstraction:** Custom hooks abstract away the implementation details, making your components cleaner and more focused on their specific responsibilities.

3. **Separation of Concerns:** Custom hooks separate concerns related to data fetching from the presentation logic in your components.

4. **Easy Testing:** Data fetching logic can be tested independently in the custom hook.

5. **Consistent API Usage:** If you need to make changes to your data fetching logic, you only need to update it in one place (the custom hook).

By adopting this approach, you promote maintainability, readability, and scalability in your React application.
