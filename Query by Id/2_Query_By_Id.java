The code you've provided is a good example of how to use React Router and React Query together to fetch and display data based on an ID in the URL.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Linking to the Details Page**: In your list component, you're mapping over an array of heroes and creating a `Link` for each one. The `to` prop of the `Link` component is set to a string that includes the ID of the hero. This will update the URL when the link is clicked and lead the user to the details page for that hero.

```jsx
{data?.data.map(hero => {
  return (
    <div key={hero.id}>
      <Link to={`/rq-super-heroes/${hero.id}`}>
        {hero.id} {hero.name}
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
})}
```

2. **Getting the ID from the URL**: In your details component (`RQSuperHeroPage`), you're using the `useParams` hook from React Router to get the ID of the hero from the URL. This ID is then passed to the `useSuperHeroData` hook to fetch the data for that hero.

```jsx
const { heroId } = useParams()
const { isLoading, data, isError, error } = useSuperHeroData(heroId)
```

3. **Fetching the Data Based on the ID**: In your `useSuperHeroData` hook, you're using the `useQuery` hook from React Query to fetch the data for the hero. The `fetchSuperHero` function is used as the query function for `useQuery`. It takes an object with a `queryKey` property, which is an array that includes the ID of the hero. This ID is then used to make a GET request to the API to fetch the data for that hero.

```jsx
const fetchSuperHero = ({ queryKey }) => {
  const heroId = queryKey[1]
  return axios.get(`http://localhost:4000/superheroes/${heroId}`)
}

export const useSuperHeroData = heroId => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()
  return useQuery(['super-hero', heroId], fetchSuperHero)
}
```

4. **Displaying the Data**: Back in your details component (`RQSuperHeroPage`), you're using the `isLoading`, `isError`, `data`, and `error` properties returned from `useSuperHeroData` to handle the different states of the data fetching process. If the data is loading, a loading message is displayed. If an error occurred, an error message is displayed. If the data was fetched successfully, it's displayed in a div.

```jsx
if (isLoading) {
  return <h2>Loading...</h2>
}

if (isError) {
  return <h2>{error.message}</h2>
}

return (
  <div>
    {data.data.name} - {data.data.alterEgo}
  </div>
)
```

This approach provides a clean and efficient way to fetch and display data based on an ID in the URL. It leverages the power of React Router for routing and React Query for data fetching and caching.
