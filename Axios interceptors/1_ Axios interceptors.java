Axios interceptors are a powerful tool for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses before they are handled by the application. They allow you to perform tasks such as adding authentication headers, logging requests, and handling errors in a centralized way.

**Types of Axios Interceptors**

There are two types of Axios interceptors:

* **Request Interceptors:** Request interceptors are executed before a request is sent to the server. You can use them to modify the request object, such as adding headers, cookies, or query parameters.

* **Response Interceptors:** Response interceptors are executed after a response is received from the server. You can use them to modify the response object, such as parsing the JSON data or handling error responses.

**Creating and Adding Interceptors**

To create an interceptor, you use the `axios.interceptors` object and call the `request` or `response` method, depending on the type of interceptor you want to create. The method takes a function as an argument, which will be executed when the request or response is intercepted.

Once you have created an interceptor, you can add it to Axios using the `axios.interceptors.request.use` or `axios.interceptors.response.use` method. The first argument to this method is the interceptor function, and the optional second argument is an error handling function.

**Examples of Interceptor Usage**

Here are some examples of how you can use Axios interceptors:

* **Add an authentication header to every request:**

```javascript
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
  config.headers.Authorization = 'Bearer ' + token;
  return config;
});
```

* **Log all requests and responses:**

```javascript
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
  console.log('Request:', config.url);
  return config;
});

axios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
  console.log('Response:', response.status, response.data);
  return response;
});
```

* **Handle errors globally:**

```javascript
axios.interceptors.response.use(null, function (error) {
  if (error.response.status === 401) {
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
  return Promise.reject(error);
});
```

**Benefits of Using Interceptors**

Axios interceptors offer several benefits, including:

* **Centralized error handling:** You can handle errors in a centralized way, rather than scattering error handling code throughout your application.

* **Easier code reusability:** Interceptors can be reused across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

* **Increased flexibility:** Interceptors allow you to modify requests and responses in a variety of ways, providing greater flexibility for implementing custom behavior.

**Conclusion**

Axios interceptors are a powerful and versatile tool for managing HTTP requests and responses in your applications. They can help you improve code organization, handle errors effectively, and add custom functionality to your HTTP interactions.

  Axios interceptors are functions that Axios calls for every request or response. They can be used to transform the request before it is sent or to transform the response before it is returned to your application. Interceptors can be thought of as middleware in Express or Mongoose [Source 2](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/interceptors).

There are two types of interceptors in Axios:

1. **Request Interceptors:** These are called before the request is sent. You can use them to modify the request, add headers, or log the request.

2. **Response Interceptors:** These are called after the response is received. You can use them to modify the response, handle errors, or log the response.

Here's an example of how to use Axios interceptors:

```jsx
// Add a request interceptor
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
 // Do something before request is sent
 return config;
}, function (error) {
 // Do something with request error
 return Promise.reject(error);
});

// Add a response interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
 // Any status code that lies within the range of 2xx causes this function to trigger
 // Do something with response data
 return response;
}, function (error) {
 // Any status codes that falls outside the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger
 // Do something with response error
 return Promise.reject(error);
});
```

You can also use interceptors to set the `Authorization` header automatically on all requests:

```jsx
axios.interceptors.request.use(req => {
 req.headers.authorization = 'my secret token';
 return req;
});
```
[Source 2](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/interceptors)

Interceptors can also be used to handle errors. For example, you can transform the error message based on the status code:

```jsx
axios.interceptors.response.use(
 res => res,
 err => {
   if (err.response.status === 404) {
     throw new Error(`${err.config.url} not found`);
   }
   throw err;
 }
);
```

Remember, you can remove an interceptor by calling the `eject` method:

```jsx
const myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

Interceptors are a powerful feature of Axios that allow you to customize the behavior of your HTTP requests and responses. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, error handling, and modifying requests and responses.
