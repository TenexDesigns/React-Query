In React Query, initial query data is a placeholder data that is provided to the query observer before the actual data is fetched from the server. This is useful for displaying a loading indicator or providing some default information to the user while the data is being fetched.

**How Initial Query Data is Used**

Initial query data is passed as a `data` prop to the `useQuery` hook. It is important to note that initial query data is not cached by React Query, so it will be overwritten once the real data is fetched from the server.

**Benefits of Using Initial Query Data**

There are several benefits to using initial query data:

* It improves the user experience by providing some data while the real data is being fetched.
* It can be used to display a loading indicator or other placeholder UI.
* It can be used to provide default information to the user, such as empty arrays or objects.

**When to Use Initial Query Data**

Initial query data is a good choice for situations where:

* The data is not critical to the user experience.
* The data is likely to change soon.
* The data is expensive to fetch.

**Use Query Client**

The `useQueryClient` hook allows you to access and interact with the React Query client instance. This can be useful for tasks such as:

* Manually fetching or refetching queries.
* Clearing the cache.
* Subscribing to query events.

**Relationship between Initial Query Data and Use Query Client**

Initial query data is provided to the `useQuery` hook, which internally uses the `useQueryClient` hook to manage the query. The `useQueryClient` hook can also be used to set initial query data, but this is typically not necessary as it can be done directly with the `useQuery` hook.

**Example Usage**

Here is an example of how to use initial query data to display a loading indicator while fetching data from a server:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isLoading, data, error } = useQuery('users', fetchUsers, {
    initialData: {
      data: [],
    },
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>An error occurred: {error}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data.data.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.id}>{user.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `useQuery` hook is used to fetch data from the `/users` endpoint. The `initialData` prop is set to an empty array, which is displayed as a loading indicator while the data is being fetched. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed in a list.

**Conclusion**

Initial query data is a useful tool for improving the user experience of data-fetching applications. It can be used to provide a placeholder UI or default information while the real data is being fetched. The `useQueryClient` hook can be used to interact with the React Query client instance and manage queries, including setting initial query data.
